# Debug-Log

Scarlet error messages used to be my headache. By irony of life (kind of), this becomes my daily job haha. Not like school, I cannot easily quit this time; so I calm down, look for hints, search for related past fixes, and think. 

After a while, I became much more comfortable with debugging and began to enjoy this thief-chasing kind of game. I try to trap the bugs in my breakpoints; if I get lost of its trace, I would set harder checkpoints. 

Along the way, I go through many unexpected places, got a better big picture and picked up some technology. 

So I decided to keep a log about some bugs I fixed. To keep it simple, I name the files in the date
I fixed the bug. Might change into other structure in the future :)

Debug当然没有那么多英雄主义或悲剧色彩，这毕竟是有意义的事情，只是她愿意这么浪漫地想，仿佛再平常的一天也光彩起来。
