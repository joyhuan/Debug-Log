# Debug-Log
The bugs that I fixed

Red error messages used to make me headache. However, in my work I have to fix them everyday. Not like
school, I cannot easily quit or ask for help from TA/friend. So I calm down and look at the hints, search
for related past fixes, and think about why would the bugs appear. After a while, I became much more
comfortable with debugging and began to enjoy this thrive-chasing kind of game. I would set breakpoints and 
trace through layers of stacks; sometimes if I got lost of the bug, I would set checkpoints in the 
better place and trace it again. 

Along the way, I go through many unexpected places, got a better big picture and picked up some technology. 
So I decided to keep a log about some bugs I fixed. To keep it simple, I name the files in the date
I fixed the bug. Might change into other structure in the future :)
