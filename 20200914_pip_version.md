# Jupyter Notebook cannot find basic modules 

## Bug
I had this problems several times when I run jupyter notebook. Once in July once in Sep. Jupyter Notebook cannot find many basic libraries 

```ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'numpy'```
even though they're obviously there. This is especilly frustrating when I try to import them in local python bash and succeed. 

I know there is this annoying python2 vs python3 thing two years ago when I took ML and CV. But python2 is deprecating and this time it is not the culprit.

Following many threads of related question dated back to 2016 I fixed it this time with nuances in pip.
