# Router

Today when I tested router I got the WAN not connected error. This is weird cause the router worked fine in another room. Based on previous experience, the problem is likely caused by connecting to the wrong jack. However, I did not find any other jack in the room. So I asked for maintainence. They came and checked my room - the diagnosis is that I was connecting to a deprecated telephone jack and I should connect to the internet jack instead. They pointed out the position of the internet jack - a place I noticed but ignored. It does not look like a jack at all, but if you come really close, you will find it is indeed a jack. 

When you hear hoof beats, think of horses, not zebras.
