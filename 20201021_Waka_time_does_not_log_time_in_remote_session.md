# Waka Time Does not Log Time in Remote Session

## Bug
I added this Waka time dev breakdown in my Git profile page. However, the time it reports is too off -- I spent much much more time than reported in coding. 

## Cause
The cause is that Waka seems to not record my time in remote session correctly, where I spent most time coding.
